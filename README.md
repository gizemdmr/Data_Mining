## Sentiment Analysis for Hotel Reviews Dataset Using Data Mining and Machine Learning Algorithms

#### Requirements:
- Python 3.6+ or python 2.7
- Jupyter Notebook

The model created using machine learning algorithms and data mining processes, performs sentiment analysis on hotel reviews.
- This project is designed to see how people's reviews about hotels change, positively or negatively, with using deep learning
- Data are first made ready by pre-processing. then nlp processes are done. finally, all the accuracy values are compared on the chart.
- Using datafiniti dataset, the accuracy of machine learning algorithms and data mining feature (Count vector, ngram tdf-idf, characters tdf-idf) methods were compared.
- Compared algorithms: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest
